# Changelog

All notable changes to clam-cms are documented here.

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and uses semantic versioning once public v0.1.0 tags begin. Pre-v0.1.0 alpha releases may still change public APIs.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.8-alpha] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- ADR-0016 site semantic layer: `AGENTS.md` (cross-tool entry) + `mantle/site.md` (Mantle's frontmatter + section bodies), filled from `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` templates and updated atomically (#107).
- `@aotterclam/create-clam-cms` npx scaffolder: fetches the starters monorepo tarball, merges `_common/` + `<archetype>/`, substitutes ADR-0016 placeholders, prints RUN_NOTES JSON. Replaces the manual `curl … | tar -xzf` + `setup:site` ritual (#109).
- 8 archetype briefs under `skills/install/archetypes/` — 4 ready/extension (`presence`, `publication`, `intake`, `blank`) + 4 roadmap-refuse (`transaction`, `reservation`, `community`, `membership`) (#110).

### Changed

- `skills/install/SKILL.md` rewritten as a Mantle-persona interview brief (~140 lines, down from 396); no more `clam_cms_request:` YAML block — Mantle gathers `brand` / `locales` / GitHub identity by conversation (#110).
- `skills/provision/SKILL.md` realigned to Mantle voice on user-facing strings; updates `mantle/site.md` `site_url:` + `revisions:` after deploy per ADR-0016. Stale `--seed-file` / `seed:initial` references removed (#111).
- `docs/prompts/` collapsed to single-sentence two-URL format; SKILL_INSTALL_URL + SKILL_ARCHETYPE_URL replace the YAML block (#110).
- CLAUDE.md table points at the starters monorepo `AotterClam/clam-cms-starters` (admin rename of `clam-cms-starter-publication` is pending; auto-redirect keeps the old URL working).

### Removed

- `starters/blank/` migrated out of this SDK monorepo into `AotterClam/clam-cms-starters/blank/`. SDK keeps a stub README pointing outward, same engineering forcing function as `packages/adapters/netlify/` (#108).
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` no longer includes `starters/*`; root `check:starters` script removed.

## [0.0.7-alpha] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Contributor governance docs: contributing guide, issue templates, PR template, label guide, release process, security policy, and code of conduct.
- Website archetype ADR for the official-site selector (`presence`, `publication`, `intake`, `transaction`, `reservation`, `community`, `membership`).
- R2-backed media upload lifecycle: create upload, direct PUT, commit, and MCP/admin endpoints.
- Better Auth-backed admin and MCP OAuth/DCR wiring with dual `/staff/mcp` and `/mcp` surfaces.
- Deferred lifecycle after-hook delivery via an optional adapter dispatcher and Cloudflare Workers Queue implementation.

### Changed

- Publication starter replaces the older blog naming and carries the v0.1 agent-provisioned site path.
- Runtime authoring paths now share entry validation for schema `pattern`, `format`, locale membership, unique indexes, and translates parent checks.
- Provision/install docs and Skills now target `0.0.7-alpha`.

## [0.0.6-alpha] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Alpha rebuild packages and starters for the v0.1.0 development line.
